This repository contains a C++ of the Google commandline flags module.
Documentation for the C++ implementation is in doc/. The python version of
gflags is now shipped seperately as it is completely independent of this
module.

See INSTALL for (generic) installation instructions for C++: basically
   ./configure && make && make install

You can also compile this under Windows, if you want.  The solution
file (for VC 7.1 and later) is in this directory.
