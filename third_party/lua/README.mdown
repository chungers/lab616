Lua Embedding
=============

Introduction
------------

This directory contains the [Lua][] language distribution. The
current version is 5.1.4.  Also there's the [Lua JIT][], which
is a higher [performance][1] just-in-time compiler and runtime
environment.

Lua is a small footprint, fast scripting language that has a
simple syntax and supports functional style programming.  It
is fast and implements proper tail recursion without causing
stack overflows.  This means it's simple to implement state
machines where one fuctions hands a 'goto' to another function.
Functions are first-class values in Lua.

Lua is popular as a scripting language for games; therefore,
its properties of simplicity and compactness (memory footprint)
as well as performance are well documented.  It's also used in
some network routers and appliances where small memory requirement
and speed are basic requiements.

Currently Lua is being considered as the scripting language for
implementing strategies, while the bulk of interfacing with data
feeds and order management systems will still be implemented in
c++ and exposed as Lua objects/ functions.
