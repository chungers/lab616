    <p>
      First, make sure you have compiled QuickFIX with MySQL support.  If you have not done this,
      go back to the build instructions for your system and follow the instructions.  Also, make
      sure you have installed MySQL and have the deamon running.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything needed to generate your MySQL database is in the <I>src/sql/mysql</I> directory. Here,
      there are the script and batch files <B>create.sh</B> and <B>create.bat</B>. You must pass in a mysql
      user with permissions to create a new database.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>./create.sh mysql</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>create.bat mysql</code>
    </p>
    <A NAME="MSSQL Database">
    <H3>MSSQL Database</H3>
    <p>
      First, make sure you have compiled QuickFIX with MSSQL support.  If you have not done this,
      go back to the build instructions for your system and follow the instructions.  Also, make
      sure you have installed MSSQL and have the deamon running.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything needed to generate your MSSQL database is in the <I>src/sql/mssql</I> directory. Here,
      there is the batch file <B>create.bat</B>. Pass in a user with permissions to create a new database.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>create.bat sa</code>
    </p>
    <A NAME="PostgreSQL Database">
    <H3>PostgreSQL Database</H3>
    <p>
      First, make sure you have compiled QuickFIX with PostgreSQL support.  If you have not done this,
      go back to the build instructions for your system and follow the instructions.  Also, make
      sure you have installed PostgreSQL and have the deamon running.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything needed to generate your PostgreSQL database is in the <I>src/sql/postgresql</I> directory. Here,
      there are the script and batch files <B>create.sh</B> and <B>create.bat</B>. You must pass in a postgresql
      user with permissions to create a new database.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>./create.sh postgres</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>create.bat postgres</code>
