Request Market Data and Place Order by conid

Bond Bid/Ask/Last Yield
API market data requests for bond contracts now return values for askYield, bidYield and lastYield.

This enhancement applies to the ActiveX, C++ and Java APIs.

New Request for Implied Volatility
A new API request, calculateImpliedVolatility, calculates the Implied Volatility based on the user-supplied option and underlying prices.

calculateImpliedVolatility(int reqId, Contract optionContract, double optionPrice, double underPrice) 

where

optionContract is the option contract.
optionPrice is the price of the option.
underPrice is the price of the underlying of the option.
The calculated implied volatility is returned by tickOptionComputation( ) in a new tick type, CUST_OPTION_COMPUTATION, which is described below.

This enhancement applies to the ActiveX, C++ and Java APIs.

New Tick Type
A new tick type has been added to the API:

CUST_OPTION_COMPUTATION - returns calculated implied volatility as a result of an calculateImpliedVolatility( ) request. 
Tick Value 53, returned by tickOptionCompution( ).
This enhancement applies to the ActiveX, C++ and Java APIs.

BID_OPTION_COMPUTATION
