/**
 * A reference to a part of a store file.  The file referenced usually lives
 * under a different region.  The part referenced is usually the top or bottom
 * half of the file.  References are made at region split time.  Being lazy
 * about copying data between the parent of the split and the split daughters
 * makes splitting faster.
 * 
 * <p>References work with {@link HalfMapFileReader}.  References know how to
 * write out the reference format in the file system and are whats juggled when
 * references are mixed in with direct store files.  The
 * {@link HalfMapFileReader} is used reading the referred to file.
 *
 * <p>References to store files located over in some other region look like
 * this in the file system
 * <code>1278437856009925445.hbaserepository,qAReLZD-OyQORZWq_vqR1k==,959247014679548184</code>:
 * i.e. an id followed by the name of the referenced region.  The data
 * ('mapfiles') of references are empty. The accompanying <code>info</code> file
 * contains the <code>midkey</code> that demarks top and bottom of the
 * referenced storefile, the id of the remote store we're referencing and
 * whether we're to serve the top or bottom region of the remote store file.
 * Note, a region is itself not splitable if it has instances of store file
 * references.  References are cleaned up by compactions.
