<h2><a name="classpath">HBase, MapReduce and the CLASSPATH</a></h2>

<p>MapReduce jobs deployed to a MapReduce cluster do not by default have access
to the HBase configuration under <code>$HBASE_CONF_DIR</code> nor to HBase classes.
You could add <code>hbase-site.xml</code> to $HADOOP_HOME/conf and add
hbase jars to the <code>$HADOOP_HOME/lib</code> and copy these
changes across your cluster but a cleaner means of adding hbase configuration
and classes to the cluster <code>CLASSPATH</code> is by uncommenting
<code>HADOOP_CLASSPATH</code> in <code>$HADOOP_HOME/conf/hadoop-env.sh</code>
adding hbase dependencies here.  For example, here is how you would amend
<code>hadoop-env.sh</code> adding the
built hbase jar, zookeeper (needed by hbase client), hbase conf, and the
<code>PerformanceEvaluation</code> class from the built hbase test jar to the
hadoop <code>CLASSPATH</code>:

<blockquote><pre># Extra Java CLASSPATH elements. Optional.
# export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=
export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=$HBASE_HOME/build/hbase-X.X.X.jar:$HBASE_HOME/build/hbase-X.X.X-test.jar:$HBASE_HOME/conf:${HBASE_HOME}/lib/zookeeper-X.X.X.jar</pre></blockquote>

<p>Expand <code>$HBASE_HOME</code> in the above appropriately to suit your
local environment.</p>

<p>After copying the above change around your cluster (and restarting), this is
how you would run the PerformanceEvaluation MR job to put up 4 clients (Presumes
a ready mapreduce cluster):

<blockquote><pre>$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop org.apache.hadoop.hbase.PerformanceEvaluation sequentialWrite 4</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<p>Another possibility, if for example you do not have access to hadoop-env.sh or
are unable to restart the hadoop cluster, is bundling the hbase jars into a mapreduce
job jar adding it and its dependencies under the job jar <code>lib/</code>
directory and the hbase conf into the job jars top-level directory.
</a>

<h2><a name="sink">HBase as MapReduce job data source and sink</a></h2>

<p>HBase can be used as a data source, {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.TableInputFormat TableInputFormat},
and data sink, {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.TableOutputFormat TableOutputFormat}, for MapReduce jobs.
Writing MapReduce jobs that read or write HBase, you'll probably want to subclass
{@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.TableMapper TableMapper} and/or
{@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.TableReducer TableReducer}.  See the do-nothing
pass-through classes {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.IdentityTableMapper IdentityTableMapper} and
{@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.IdentityTableReducer IdentityTableReducer} for basic usage.  For a more
involved example, see {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.RowCounter}
or review the <code>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.TestTableMapReduce</code> unit test.
</p>

<p>Running mapreduce jobs that have hbase as source or sink, you'll need to
specify source/sink table and column names in your configuration.</p>

<p>Reading from hbase, the TableInputFormat asks hbase for the list of
regions and makes a map-per-region or <code>mapred.map.tasks maps</code>,
whichever is smaller (If your job only has two maps, up mapred.map.tasks
to a number &gt; number of regions). Maps will run on the adjacent TaskTracker
if you are running a TaskTracer and RegionServer per node.
Writing, it may make sense to avoid the reduce step and write yourself back into
hbase from inside your map. You'd do this when your job does not need the sort
and collation that mapreduce does on the map emitted data; on insert,
hbase 'sorts' so there is no point double-sorting (and shuffling data around
your mapreduce cluster) unless you need to. If you do not need the reduce,
you might just have your map emit counts of records processed just so the
framework's report at the end of your job has meaning or set the number of
reduces to zero and use TableOutputFormat. See example code
below. If running the reduce step makes sense in your case, its usually better
to have lots of reducers so load is spread across the hbase cluster.</p>

<p>There is also a new hbase partitioner that will run as many reducers as
currently existing regions.  The 
{@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.HRegionPartitioner} is suitable
when your table is large and your upload is not such that it will greatly
alter the number of existing regions when done; otherwise use the default
partitioner.
</p>

<h2><a name="bulk">Bulk import writing HFiles directly</a></h2>
<p>If importing into a new table, its possible to by-pass the HBase API
and write your content directly to the filesystem properly formatted as
HBase data files (HFiles).  Your import will run faster, perhaps as much
as an order of magnitude faster if not more.
</p>
<p>You will need to write a MapReduce job.  The map task will know how to
pull from your data source.  Your reduce task will need to be hooked up to
{@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.HFileOutputFormat}.  It expects to receive a row id and a value.
The row id must be formatted as a {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.ImmutableBytesWritable} and the
value as a {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.KeyValue} (A KeyValue holds the value for a cell and
its coordinates; row/family/qualifier/timestamp, etc.).  Note that you must
specify a timestamp when you create the KeyValue in your map task
otherwise the KeyValue will be created with the default LATEST_TIMESTAMP (Long.MAX_VALUE).  
Use System.currentTimeMillis() if your data does not inherently bear a timestamp.
Your reduce task
will also need to emit the KeyValues in order.  See {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.KeyValueSortReducer}
for an example reducer that emits KeyValues in order.
</p>
<p>Most importantly, you will also need to ensure that your MapReduce job
ensures a total ordering among all keys.  MapReduce by default distributes
keys among reducers using a Partitioner that hashes on the map task output
key: i.e. the reducer a key ends up in is by default determined as follows
<code> (key.hashCode() &amp; Integer.MAX_VALUE) % numReduceTasks</code>.
Keys are sorted by the MapReduce framework before they are passed to the reducer
BUT the sort is scoped to the particular reducer.  Its not a global sort.
Given the default hash Partitioner, if the keys were 0-4 (inclusive), and you
had configured two reducers, reducer 0 would have get keys 0, 2 and 4 whereas
reducer 1 would get keys 1 and 3 (in order).  For your bulk import to work,
the keys need to be orderd so reducer 0 gets keys 0-2 and reducer 1 gets keys
3-4 (See TotalOrderPartitioner up in hadoop for more on what this means). 
To achieve total ordering, you will likely need to write a Partitioner
that is intimate with your tables key namespace and that knows how
to distribute keys among the reducers so a total order is maintained
(You need at least hadoop 0.20.1 setting your own Partitioner -- see MAPREDUCE-565).
</p>
<p>See org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.TestHFileOutputFormat for an example that puts together
{@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.KeyValueSortReducer} and {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.HFileOutputFormat}.</p>

<p>HFileOutputFormat writes HFiles.  When your MapReduce file finishes, in your
output directory you will have many HFiles.  Run the script <code>bin/loadtable.rb</code>
to move the files from the MapReduce output directory under hbase.  See head of script
for how to run it.  This script
also adds the new table data to the hbase catalog tables.  When the script completes,
on the next run of the hbase metascanner -- it usually runs every minute -- your
new table should be visible and populated.</p>

<h2><a name="examples">Example Code</a></h2>
<h3>Sample Row Counter</h3>
<p>See {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.RowCounter}.  This job uses
{@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.TableInputFormat TableInputFormat} and
does a count of all rows in specified table.
You should be able to run
it by doing: <code>% ./bin/hadoop jar hbase-X.X.X.jar</code>.  This will invoke
the hbase MapReduce Driver class.  Select 'rowcounter' from the choice of jobs
offered. This will emit rowcouner 'usage'.  Specify tablename, column to count
and output directory.  You may need to add the hbase conf directory to <code>$HADOOP_HOME/conf/hadoop-env.sh#HADOOP_CLASSPATH</code>
so the rowcounter gets pointed at the right hbase cluster (or, build a new jar
with an appropriate hbase-site.xml built into your job jar).
