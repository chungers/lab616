        Esper has been highly optimized to handle very high throughput streams with very little latency between event receipt and output result posting.
        It is also possible to use Esper on a soft-real-time or hard-real-time JVM to maximize predictability even
        further.
    </p><p>
        This section describes performance best practices and explains how to assess Esper performance by using our
        provided performance kit.

            </p><pre class="programlisting">Esper exceeds over 500 000 event/s on a dual CPU 2GHz Intel based hardware,
with engine latency below 3 microseconds average (below 10us with more than 
99% predictability) on a VWAP benchmark with 1000 statements registered in the system 
- this tops at 70 Mbit/s at 85% CPU usage.

Esper also demonstrates linear scalability from 100 000 to 500 000 event/s on this 
hardware, with consistent results accross different statements.

Other tests demonstrate equivalent performance results
(straight through processing, match all, match none, no statement registered,
VWAP with time based window or length based windows).
                
Tests on a laptop demonstrated about 5x time less performance - that is 
between 70 000 event/s and 200 000 event/s - which still gives room for easy 
testing on small configuration.</pre><p>

				Esper runs on a JVM and you need to be familiar with JVM tuning.
				Key parameters to consider include minimum and maximum heap memory and nursery heap sizes.
				Statements with time-based or length-based data windows can consume large amounts of memory as their size or length can be large.
			</p><p>
				For time-based data windows, one needs to be aware that the memory consumed depends on the actual event stream input
				throughput. Event pattern instances also consume memory, especially when using the "every"
				keyword in patterns to repeat pattern sub-expressions - which again will depend on the actual event stream input throughput.
			</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="perf-tips-2"></a>14.2.2.&nbsp;Compare Esper to other solutions</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
				If you compare Esper performance to the performance of another solution, you need to ensure that your statements have
				truly equivalent semantics. The is because between different vendors the event processing language can be seem fairly similar 
				whoever may, for all similarities, produce different results.
			</p><p>
				For example some vendor solution mandates the use of "bounded streams". The next statement shows one vendor's event processing syntax:
			</p><pre class="programlisting">// Other (name omitted) vendor solution statement:
select * from (select * from Market where ticker = 'GOOG') retain 1 event
// The above is NOT an Esper statement</pre><p>
				The semantically equivalent statement in Esper is:
			</p><pre class="programlisting">// Esper statement with the same semantics:
select * from MarketData(ticker='$').win:length(1)</pre><p>
				As an example, a NOT semantically equivalent statement in Esper is:
			</p><pre class="programlisting">// Esper statement that DOES ***NOT*** HAVE the same semantics 
// No length window was used
select * from MarketData(ticker='$')</pre></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="perf-tips-3"></a>14.2.3.&nbsp;Input and Output Bottlenecks</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
				Your application receives output events from Esper statements through the <tt class="literal">UpdateListener</tt> interface or via the strongly-typed subscriber POJO object. Such output events are delivered by the application or timer thread(s) that sends an input event into the engine instance.
			</p><p>
				The processing of output events that your listener or subscriber performs temporarily blocks the thread until the processing completes, and may thus reduce throughput. It can therefore be beneficial for your application to process output events asynchronously and not block the Esper engine while an output event is being processed by your listener, especially if your listener code performs blocking IO operations.
			</p><p>
				For example, your application may want to send output events to a JMS destination or write output event data to a relational database. For optimal throughput, consider performing such blocking operations in a separate thread.
			</p><p>
				Additionally, when reading input events from a store or network in a performance test, you may find that Esper processes events faster then you are able to feed events into Esper. In such case you may want to consider an in-memory driver for use in performance testing. Also consider decoupling your read operation from the event processing operation (sendEvent method) by having multiple readers or by pre-fetching your data from the store.

				Esper provides the configuration option to use engine-level queues and threadpools for inbound, outbound and internal executions. See <a href="api.html#api-threading-advanced" title="10.6.1.&nbsp;Advanced Threading">Section&nbsp;10.6.1, &#8220;Advanced Threading&#8221;</a> for more information.

				By selecting the underlying event in the select-clause we can reduce load on the engine, since the 
				engine does not need to generate a new output event for each input event.
			</p><p>
				For example, the following statement returns the underlying event to update listeners:
			</p><pre class="programlisting">// Better performance
select * from RFIDEvent</pre><p>
				In comparison, the next statement selects individual properties. This statement requires the engine to generate an output event that 
				contains exactly the required properties:
			</p><pre class="programlisting">// Less good performance
select assetId, zone, xlocation, ylocation from RFIDEvent </pre></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="perf-tips-5"></a>14.2.6.&nbsp;Prefer stream-level filtering over post-data-window filtering</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
				Esper stream-level filtering is very well optimized, while filtering via the where-clause post any data windows is not optimized. 
				In very simple statements that don't have data windows this distinction can make a performance difference.
			</p><p>
				Consider the example below, which performs stream-level filtering:
			</p><pre class="programlisting">// Better performance : stream-level filtering
select * from MarketData(ticker = 'GOOG')</pre><p>
				The example below is the equivalent (same semantics) statement and performs post-data-window filtering without a data window.
				The engine does not optimize statements that filter in the where-clause for the reason that data window views are generally present.
			</p><pre class="programlisting">// Less good performance : post-data-window filtering
select * from Market where ticker = 'GOOG'</pre><p>
				Thus this optimization technique applies to statements without any data window. 
			</p><p>
				When a data window is used, the semantics change. Let's look at an example to better understand the difference:
				In the next statement only GOOG market events enter the length window:
			</p><pre class="programlisting">select avg(price) from MarketData(ticker = 'GOOG').win:length(100)</pre><p>
				The above statement computes the average price of GOOG market data events for the last 100 GOOG market data events. 
			</p><p>
				Compare the filter position to a filter in the where clause. 
				The following statement is NOT equivalent as all events enter the data window (not just GOOG events):
			</p><pre class="programlisting">select avg(price) from Market.win:length(100) where ticker = 'GOOG'</pre><p>
				The statement above computes the average price of all market data events for the last 100 market data events, and outputs results only for GOOG.
			</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="perf-tips-6"></a>14.2.7.&nbsp;Reduce the use of arithmetic in expressions</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
				Esper does not yet attempt to pre-evaluate arithmetic expressions that produce constant results.
			</p><p>
				Therefore, a filter expression as below is optimized:
			</p><pre class="programlisting">// Better performance : no arithmetic
select * from MarketData(price&gt;40) </pre><p>
				While the engine cannot currently optimize this expression:
			</p><pre class="programlisting">// Less good performance : with arithmetic
select * from MarketData(price+10&gt;50) </pre></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="perf-tips-7"></a>14.2.8.&nbsp;Consider using EventPropertyGetter for fast access to event properties</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
				The EventPropertyGetter interface is useful for obtaining an event property value without property name table lookup 
				given an EventBean instance that is of the same event type that the property getter was obtained from.
			</p><p>
				When compiling a statement, the EPStatement instance lets us know the EventType via the getEventType() method.
				From the EventType we can obtain EventPropertyGetter instances for named event properties.
			</p><p>
				To demonstrate, consider the following simple statement:
			</p><pre class="programlisting">select symbol, avg(price) from Market group by symbol</pre><p>
				After compiling the statement, obtain the EventType and pass the type to the listener:
			</p><pre class="programlisting">EPStatement stmt = epService.getEPAdministrator().createEPL(stmtText);
MyGetterUpdateListener listener = new MyGetterUpdateListener(stmt.getEventType());</pre><p>
				The listener can use the type to obtain fast getters for property values of events for the same type:
			</p><pre class="programlisting">public class MyGetterUpdateListener implements StatementAwareUpdateListener {
    private final EventPropertyGetter symbolGetter;
    private final EventPropertyGetter avgPriceGetter;

    public MyGetterUpdateListener(EventType eventType) {
        symbolGetter = eventType.getGetter("symbol");
        avgPriceGetter = eventType.getGetter("avg(price)");
    }</pre><p>
				Last, the update method can invoke the getters to obtain event property values:
			</p><pre class="programlisting">    public void update(EventBean[] eventBeans, EventBean[] oldBeans, EPStatement epStatement, EPServiceProvider epServiceProvider) {
        String symbol = (String) symbolGetter.get(eventBeans[0]);
        long volume = (Long) volumeGetter.get(eventBeans[0]);
        // some more logic here
    }</pre></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="perf-tips-8"></a>14.2.9.&nbsp;Consider casting the underlying event</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
				When an application requires the value of most or all event properties, it can often be best to simply select the underlying event via wildcard
				and cast the received events.
			</p><p>
				Let's look at the sample statement:
			</p><pre class="programlisting">select * from MarketData(symbol regexp 'E[a-z]')</pre><p>
				An update listener to the statement may want to cast the received events to the expected underlying event class:
			</p><pre class="programlisting">    public void update(EventBean[] eventBeans, EventBean[] eventBeans) {
        MarketData md = (MarketData) eventBeans[0].getUnderlying();
        // some more logic here
    }</pre></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="perf-tips-9"></a>14.2.10.&nbsp;Turn off logging</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
	Since Esper 1.10, even if you don't have a log4j configuration file in place, Esper will make sure to minimize execution path logging overhead.
	For prior versions, and to reduce logging overhead overall, we recommend the "WARN" log level or the "INFO" log level.
			</p><p>
	Please see the log4j configuration file in "etc/infoonly_log4j.xml" for example log4j settings.
			</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="perf-tips-10"></a>14.2.11.&nbsp;Disable view sharing</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
				By default, Esper compares streams and views in use with existing statement's streams and views, and then reuses views to efficiently share resources between statements. The benefit is reduced resources usage, however the potential cost is that in multithreaded applications a shared view may mean excessive locking of multiple processing threads.
			</p><p>
				Consider disabling view sharing for better threading performance if your application overall uses fewer statements and statements have very similar streams, filters and views. 
			</p><p>
				View sharing can be disabled via XML configuration or API, and the next code snippet shows how, using the API:
			</p><pre class="programlisting">Configuration config = new Configuration();
config.getEngineDefaults().getViewResources().setShareViews(false);</pre></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="perf-tips-11"></a>14.2.12.&nbsp;Tune or disable delivery order guarantees</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
				If your application is not a multithreaded application, or you application is not sensitive to the order of delivery of result events to your application listeners, then consider disabling the delivery order guarantees the engine makes towards ordered delivery of results to listeners:
			</p><pre class="programlisting">Configuration config = new Configuration();
config.getEngineDefaults().getThreading().setListenerDispatchPreserveOrder(false);</pre><p>
				If your application is not a multithreaded application, or your application uses the <tt class="literal">insert into</tt> clause to make results of one statement available for further consuming statements but does not require ordered delivery of results from producing statements to consuming statements, you may disable delivery order guarantees between statements: 
			</p><pre class="programlisting">Configuration config = new Configuration();
config.getEngineDefaults().getThreading().setInsertIntoDispatchPreserveOrder(false);</pre><p>
				Additional configuration options are available and described in the configuration section that specify timeout values and spin or thread context switching.
			</p><p>
				Esper logging will log the following informational message when guaranteed delivery order to listeners is enabled and spin lock times exceed the default or configured timeout : <tt class="literal">Spin wait timeout exceeded in listener dispatch</tt>.
				The respective message for delivery from <tt class="literal">insert into</tt> statements to consuming statements is <tt class="literal">Spin wait timeout exceeded in insert-into dispatch</tt>.
			</p><p>
				If your application sees messages that spin lock times are exceeded, your application has several options: First, disabling preserve order is an option. Second, ensure your listener does not perform (long-running) blocking operations before returning, for example by performing output event processing in a separate thread. Third, change the timeout value to a larger number to block longer without logging the message.

				The subscriber object is a technique for receive result data that has performance advantages over the <tt class="literal">UpdateListener</tt> interface. Please refer to <a href="api.html#api-admin-subscriber" title="10.3.3.&nbsp;Setting a Subscriber Object">Section&nbsp;10.3.3, &#8220;Setting a Subscriber Object&#8221;</a>.
			</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="perf-tips-13"></a>14.2.14.&nbsp;High-Arrival-Rate Streams and Single Statements</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
				A statement is associated with certain statement state that consists of current aggregation values, partial pattern matches, data windows or other view state depending on whether your statement uses such constructs. When an engine receives events it updates statement state under locking such that statement state remains consistent under concurrent multi-threaded access.
			</p><p>
				For high-volume streams, the locking required to protected statement state may slow down or introduce blocking for very high arrival rates of events that apply to the very same statement and its state. You may want to consider splitting a single statement into multiple statements that each look for a certain subset of the high-arrival-rate stream. There is very little cost in terms of memory or CPU resources per statement, the engine can handle larger number of statements usually as efficiently as single statements.
			</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="perf-tips-14"></a>14.2.15.&nbsp;Performance, JVM, OS and hardware</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
				Performance will also depend on your JVM (Sun HotSpot, BEA JRockit, IBM J9), your operating system and your hardware.
				A JVM performance index such as specJBB at <a href="http://www.spec.org" target="_top">spec.org</a> can be used. For memory intensive statement, you may want
				to consider 64bit architecture that can address more than 2GB or 3GB of memory, although a 64bit JVM usually comes with a slow performance penalty due to
				more complex pointer address management.
			</p><p>
				The choice of JVM, OS and hardware depends on a number of factors and therefore a definite suggestion is hard to make.
				The choice depends on the number of statements, and number of threads.
				A larger number of threads would benefit of more CPU and cores. If you have very low latency requirements, you should consider
				getting more GHz per core, and possibly soft real-time JVM to enforce GC determinism at the JVM level, or even consider dedicated hardware such as Azul.
				If your statements utilize large data windows, more RAM and heap space will be utilized hence you should clearly plan and account for that and possibly consider 64bit architectures or consider
				<a href="http://www.espertech.com/products/" target="_top">EsperHA</a>.
			</p><p>
				The number and type of statements is a factor that cannot be generically accounted for.
				The benchmark kit can help test out some requirements and establish baselines, and for more complex use cases
				a simulation or proof of concept would certainly works best.

            The benchmark application is basically an Esper event server build with Esper that listens to remote clients
            over TCP.
            Remote clients send MarketData(ticker, price, volume) streams to the event server.
            The Esper event server is started with 1000 statements of one single kind (unless otherwise written),
            with one statement per ticker symbol, unless the statement kind does not depend on the symbol.
            The statement prototype is provided along the results with a '$' instead of the actual ticker symbol value.
            The Esper event server is entirely multithreaded and can leverage the full power of 32bit or 64bit
            underlying hardware multi-processor multi-core architecture.
        </p><p>
                The kit also prints out when starting up the event size and the theoretical maximal throughput you can get on a
                100 Mbit/s and 1 Gbit/s network. Keep in mind a 100 Mbit/s network will be overloaded at about 400 000 event/s when using our kit despite
                the small size of events.

                        At that stage you should also start to set min and max JVM heap. A good start is 1GB as in
                        <tt class="literal">-Xms1g -Xmx1g</tt>
                    </p></li><li><p>
                        Write the statement you want to benchmark given that client will send a stream MarketData(String
                        ticker, int volume, double price), add it to
                        <tt class="literal">etc/statements.properties</tt>
                        under
                        your own KEY and use the
                        <tt class="literal">-mode KEY</tt>
                        when you start the Esper event server.
                        Use <tt class="literal">'$'</tt> in the statement to create a prototype. For every symbol, a statement
                        will get registered with all <tt class="literal">'$'</tt> replaced by the actual symbol value (f.e. <tt class="literal">'GOOG'</tt>)
                    </p></li><li><p>
                        Ensure client and server are using the same
                        <tt class="literal">-Desper.benchmark.symbol=1000</tt> value.
                        This sets the number of symbol to use (thus may set the number of statement if you are using
                        a statement prototype, and governs how MarketData event are represented over the network.
                        Basically all events will have the same size over the network to ensure predictability and will be ranging
                        between <tt class="literal">S0AA</tt> and <tt class="literal">S999A</tt> if you use 1000 as a value here (prefix with S and padded with A up to
                        a fixed length string. Volume and price attributes will be randomized.
                    </p></li><li><p>
                        By default the benchmark registers a subscriber to the statement(s). Use <tt class="literal">-Desper.benchmark.ul</tt> to use
                        an UpdateListener instead. Note that the subscriber contains suitable update(..) methods for the default
                        proposed statement in the <tt class="literal">etc/statements.properties</tt> file but might not be suitable if you change statements due
                        to the strong binding with statement results. Refer to <a href="api.html#api-receive-results" title="10.3.2.&nbsp;Receiving Statement Results">Section&nbsp;10.3.2, &#8220;Receiving Statement Results&#8221;</a>.
                    </p></li><li><p>
                        Establish a performance baseline in simulation mode (without clients). Use the
                        <tt class="literal">-rate 1x5000</tt>
                        option
                        to simulate one client (one thread) sending 5000 evt/s. You can ramp up both the number of client simulated
                        thread and their emission rate to maximize CPU
                        utilization.
                        The right number should mimic the client emission rate you will use in the client/server benchmark
                        and should thus be
                        consistent with what your client machine and network will be able to send.
                        On small hardware, having a lot of thread with slow rate will not help getting high throughput in this
                        simulation mode.
                    </p></li><li><p>
                        Do performance runs with client/server mode. Remove the
                        <tt class="literal">-rate NxM</tt>
                        option from the runServer script or Ant task.
                        Start the server with
                        <tt class="literal">-help</tt>
                        to display the possible server options (listen port, statistics, fan out options etc).
                        On the remote machine, start one or more client. Use
                        <tt class="literal">-help</tt>
                        to display the possible client options (remote port, host,
                        emission rate). The client will output the actual number of event it is sending to the server.
                        If the server gets overloaded (or if you turned on
                        <tt class="literal">-queue</tt>
                        options on the server) the client will likely
                        not be able to reach its target rate.
                    </p><p>
                        Usually you will get better performance by using server side <tt class="literal">-queue -1</tt> option so as to have
                        each client connection handled by a single thread pipeline. If you change to 0 or more, there will be
                        intermediate structures to pass the event stream in an asynchronous fashion. This will increase context
                        switching, although if you are using many clients, or are using the <tt class="literal">-sleep xxx</tt> (xxx in
                        milliseconds) to simulate a listener delay you may get better performance.
                    </p><p>
                        The most important server side option is <tt class="literal">-stat xxx</tt> (xxx in seconds) to print out
                        throughput and latency statistics aggregated over the last xxx seconds (and reset every time).
                        It will produce both internal Esper latency (in nanosecond) and also end to end latency (in millisecond, including network time).
                        If you are measuring end to end latency you should make sure your server and client machine(s) are having the same time
                        with f.e. ntpd with a good enough precision.
                        The stat format is like:
