Avro C Bindings (libavro)

The code in this directory is the C bindings for Avro.

Currently, there are only the Avro primitives with their corresponding
unit tests.  The unit tests currently only check for proper
encoding/decoding within the C library.  Interoperability tests are
comming soon.

Only the memory-backed Avro handle is working right now although
adding file and network io support is easy thank to the Apache
Portable Runtime which the Avro C bindings depend on.

For API details, view the file avro.h.  The documentation is a work in
progress.  The test cases (test_avro_*.c) also serve as great examples
of how to use the API.

libavro compile and passes all tests on Linux.  On MacOS X, 4 out of 5
unit tests pass.  Portability is a definite design goal but currently
the development emphasis is on Linux.
