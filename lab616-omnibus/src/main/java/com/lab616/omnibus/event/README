Design Notes

1. Why use annotation for Statement and Pattern, instead of just passing
string?

Using annotations basically means java classes must be defined to encapsulate
the EPL statement and subscriber object (AbstractEventWatcher).  The reason for
doing this is to make sure that any statements that are issued to Esper have
been tested.  Each event watcher class should have accompanying unit tests to
verify that they work.  Otherwise, we can have unpredictable things happening
in production because Esper inherently does no static type checking or making
sure that a statement even works correctly.

2. #1 explains why we don't have Builders for ad-hoc statement construction.  
Instead, everything should map to a tested AbstractEventWatcher class.
